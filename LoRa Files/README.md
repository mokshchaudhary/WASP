# Editing the Sender

Edit the LoRa_sender to add more sensors according to your need.</br>
The code is commented at places which you need to edit to add more sensors

  `int a = random(0,100);`</br>
  `int b = random(0,100);`</br>
  `int c = random(0,100);`</br>
  `int d = random(0,100);`</br>
  
  Instead of `random`  add code for the sensor</br>
  You will need to add additional code to make the sensor the code </br>
